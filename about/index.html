				<h2>The <span> Deeper </span> Message</h2>
				<p>
				  Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Bill Gates, Linus Torvalds, Mark Zuckerberg and many more, all, 
				  innovators from the digital age, changed our lives for the better. All of these people have 
				  endorsed the hacker culture many times over. They had that drive in them to work on something 
				  they thought was missing in this world and truly believed in their work. 
				</p>
				<p>
				  Going back in time, the 70’s was considered a <span> golden age for free thinking, technological progress </span>
				  and an artistic blend in the silicon valley. 
				</p>
				<p>
				  <span> “The people who invented the twenty-first century were 
				  hippies from the west coast like Steve Jobs, because they saw differently.” </span> Two decades later, the 
				  Free Software Foundation or more popularly the Open Source movement changed the way the world looked 
				  at software. In the early 21st century, a fresh string of companies based on the internet strived to 
				  deliver information to the masses and keep everyone connected. 
				</p>
				<p>
				  <span> Only one thing is common between all of these. These were all startups. </span> No big company has ever been 
				  able to shape ideology the way startups have.

						<p><span><em>But why is all this here?</em></span></p> 
						<P>
						  Some of us at KHMD feel that what the Silicon Valley was in terms in innovation 
						  in the 70’s is what India is right now (or at least what it will be). Over the past few years, 
						  India has turned out to be the startup centre of the world. We’re sure that India will soon be the place 
						  to be in terms of technological innovation. The startup culture today is turning out to be a true embodiment 
						  of the late 70’s hacker culture. But we believe that this culture is more than just about skills.
						</p> 
						<p>
						  It’s a complete change in mindset that we’re looking at. A mindset that looks at a problem and solves it without being a “me too” solution. And we feel proud to say the the epicentre of all this is Bengaluru. 
						</p>
