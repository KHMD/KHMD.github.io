                    KHMD is a student-centric platform developed and managed by a group of like-minded students of Kumarans who believe in the Hacker culture. It is aimed at the tech enthusiasts and beginners to nurture their skills and foster their interest in science and technology. We provide a platform for students in Kumarans to interact with experts and build their own projects. KHMD is the place where beginners can learn new things in the world of technology and more experienced seniors and experts can mentor them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We work on various projects in diverse areas of technology like Arduino, Web, Android and Design among others. We also work on introducing less interested students to the amazing fields of science and technology. Technology is everywhere and everyone has the creativity and imagination to create something new and exciting with technology.  All they needs is the support and freedom to do this.  We want to build a community of individuals in school who want to create technology to help each other and the whole world.
                </p>

                        Ignite (Aug 2016) marked the beginning of a transitionary period for KHMD. It was the first event in a period of new leadership and a new line of thinking on what KHMD should be. The idea was to put out the message that science and technology was something that everyone could integrate into their interests. The demos illustrated the use of technology to solve simple everyday problems.

                        Interface (Nov 2015) was the first edition of KHMD's flagship event - Interface. This was an event that brought in many changes to the incumbent IT Fair by turning the very intention of the event on it's head. It went from an academic display event to an event where students showed what they built and also helped students develop skills through workshops in Web Design and Design Thinking along with events like Hour Of Code and flash talks on various topics. Interface 2015 brought the community together in terms of collaboration and set a precedent for all future Interface events.

                        Infuse (March 2015) was the first ever event where KHMD came together. The intention of this event was to spread the idea of what the community should aspire to become. Mr. Satya Prasad, a professional with over 20 years of experience in the tech industry, came and talked about the maker culture in the Silicon Valley and how we were doing something that is fundamentally important in today's world. He drove home the point that the act of creation is much more important than mere consumption. A bunch of 11th graders also showed a prototype of a cheap VR headset aptly named "Oculus Thrift". Infuse went on to define what KHMD became.
